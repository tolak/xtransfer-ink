/// This will be a simple lending contract where users can:
///
/// 1. Lend tokens accepted by the smart contract.
/// The allowance and disallowance of tokens is done by the accounts which have a manager role
/// Upon lending, the user gets a PSP-22 token representing their share of the current liquidity pool
///
/// 2. Borrow tokens from the smart contract by depositing collateral tokens.
/// The tokens which can be deposited as collateral are allowed and disallowed by the accounts with manager role
/// Upon borrowing user gets a PSP-34 token representing info about their loan (how much assets were borrowed,
/// when did they borrow, what asset was borrowed, what asset was used as collateral, how much collateral assets
/// were deposited, the liquidation price of the loan and if it was liquidated or not)
///
/// 3. Repay their loan by depositing the borrowed amount of borrowed assets along with interest.
/// The contract determines how much a user needs to deposit and how much collateral they get back by an NFT token
/// which the user gets upon borrowing the assets. The user is also able to repay a portion of the loan, but will only get
/// a portion of their collateral assets back, while the liquidation price will stay the same
///
/// 4. Withdraw tokens deposited to the smart contract
/// User deposits their share tokens to the smart contract and the smart contract determines how much of the underlying
/// asset they get back
///
/// 5. Liquidate a loan
/// User can call a liquidation of a loan. If the price of collateral token of the loan is below or equal to the liquidation price,
/// the loan is then liquidated and the user performing the liquidation will get 1% of the liquidated assets
///
/// 6. Allow and disallow assets for lending
/// This can only be done by the accounts with the manager role
///
/// 7. Allow and disallow assets to be used as a collateral
/// This can only be done by the accounts with the manager role
///
/// 8. Pause the contract
/// Users with the manager role can pause the contract. If the contract is paused, no borrowing or lending can be performed
/// Users can still repay their loans, liquidate loans or withdraw their deposits
